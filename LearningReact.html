    <h1>JS vs React</h1>
    <p>
      JS is a programming language that is used to create dynamic and
      interactive web pages. It is used to create the logic of web pages and is
      often used in conjunction with HTML and CSS.
    </p>
    <p>
      React on the other hand is a JavaScript library that is used to create
      reusable UI components. It is used to create the structure of web pages
      and is often used in conjunction with HTML and CSS.
    </p>

    <p>JS is imperative and React is declarative</p>
    <p>JS is imperative : you define steps to reach your desire state</p>
    <p>
      React is declarative : you define what you want to see. you define the
      target UI state and then react will take care of the rest
    </p>
